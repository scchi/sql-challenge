-- A. Data Cleansing Steps

-- In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:
--
-- - Convert the week_date to a DATE format
-- - Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
-- - Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
-- - Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
-- - Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
-- - Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
-- - Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns
-- - Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

  FROM
    data_mart.clean_weekly_sales

SELECT
  a.week_number
FROM

  GROUP BY
    month_number,
    platform
)
SELECT

  ROUND(
    100 * SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN platform = 'Retail' THEN monthly_sales
        ELSE NULL
      END
    ) / SUM(monthly_sales) :: NUMERIC,
    2
  ) AS retail_percentage,

-- 7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

WITH yearly_demographic_sales_cte AS (
  SELECT

ORDER BY
  sales_contribution DESC

-- 9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

SELECT
  calendar_year,
  ROUND(
    SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN platform = 'Retail' THEN sales
        ELSE NULL

      CASE
        WHEN platform = 'Retail' THEN transactions
        ELSE NULL
      END
    ),
    0
  ) as retail_average_transactions,
    ROUND(
    SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN platform = 'Shopify' THEN sales
        ELSE NULL
      END
    ) / SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN platform = 'Shopify' THEN transactions
        ELSE NULL
      END

    0

--  C. Before & After Analysis

-- Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.
--
-- We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before
--
-- Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:
--
-- 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
-- 2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
-- 3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

-- D. Bonus Question

-- Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?

-- - region
-- - platform
-- - age_band
-- - demographic
-- - customer_type

-- Do you have any further recommendations for Dannyâ€™s team at Data Mart or any interesting insights based off this analysis?
